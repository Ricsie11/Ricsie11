<h1>Full Stack Web Developer</h1> </br>
<h2>About Me</h2> </br>
I am a Full Stack Web Developer passionate about building robust, efficient, and scalable web applications. I enjoy working across the entire development stack—crafting intuitive user interfaces on the frontend while designing powerful, secure, and reliable systems on the backend. My journey in software engineering is driven by curiosity, problem-solving, and a desire to create impactful digital experiences.<br>

<h2>My Journey into Software Engineering</h2> <br>
My fascination with how computers, the internet, and web applications interact sparked my interest in software engineering. I’ve always been intrigued by both the visible parts of applications users interact with and the hidden systems that power them behind the scenes. This curiosity led me down a structured learning path where I developed skills in frontend development, backend engineering, and system design.<br>

<h2>Passions & Inspirations</h2> <br>
I am deeply inspired by the synergy between frontend interfaces and backend systems. I enjoy transforming ideas into responsive, user-friendly designs while ensuring that the underlying architecture is efficient, scalable, and secure. I am particularly passionate about building systems that feel seamless to users while remaining powerful and well-structured under the hood.<br>

<h2>Goals</h2><br>
My professional goals focus on becoming a well-rounded and highly effective Full Stack Developer:<br>
✅ Design and build clean, responsive, and accessible frontend interfaces that deliver excellent user experiences.<br>
✅ Proficiently master APIs and create clear, efficient RESTful services that connect frontend and backend systems.<br>
✅ Become skilled in database management, working with both SQL (e.g., PostgreSQL) and NoSQL (e.g., MongoDB) to build scalable data solutions.<br>
✅ Implement secure authentication and authorization systems to protect user data and application integrity.<br>
✅ Master modern backend frameworks such as Express.js or Django to build maintainable and scalable applications.<br>

<h2>Current Focus</h2><br>
I am currently focused on strengthening my full-stack development workflow, with an emphasis on building well-designed RESTful APIs and integrating them seamlessly with frontend applications. This includes improving API design, optimizing performance, enhancing security, and delivering smooth end-to-end user experiences.
